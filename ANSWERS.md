You wouldn't. Hooks and custom hooks make function components more flexible.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
Render: Put elements and data into the virtual dom.
componentDidMount: Called the first time a component is rendered.

To further abstract state so that you Don't Repeat Yourself.
